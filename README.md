## My process
This project was a part of an online fullstack roadmap by Zach Gollwitzer. It was one of the milestone projects encountered as a follower of the course. Therefore, the solution is a combination of my own individual effort mixed with guidance from his tutorial videos. I had attempted an individual solution first before reffering to the tutorial videos once I had gotten stuck and unable to find a solution to the CSS issues I was having. Furthermore, while in the tutorials, a complete Flexbox solution was presented, I opted to stay with non-Flexbox solution for the card itself and only utilized Flexbox to center the card on the page.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- 
### Continued development
Since I did not focus on a Flexbox implementation from the beginning, I would like to retry the challenge utilizing Flexbox in every aspect of the project. I believe it will be an easier implementation while also giving me more exposure to the Flexbox structure; of which, I am still relatively new.
